# Homework-5
Creating a work day scheduler
In this homework, we are using jquery and css to create a 9-5 calender for the user

To start, I used bootstrap to create a table on the page, added classes, and adjusted the column length to have my time and save button columns to be 15% of the page, and my input text box to be 70% of the page

I then navigated to w3 schoolsto figure out how to populate and change the style of the date using moment

Next I had to create a function to be able to save the texts in my input boxes. For this I created a js document and a click function.
To save the texts boxes, I saved whatever was found in that row's text box to the local storage.


Lastly, I created a loadSettings function that would get the text from my local storage so once I saved it, and refreshed, the text would still be in my textboxes
